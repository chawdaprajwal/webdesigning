        <p1>Cicada 3301 is a nickname given to three sets of puzzles posted under the name "3301" online between 2012 and 2014.</p1>
        <p2>The first puzzle started on January 4, 2012, on 4chan and ran for nearly a month. <p3>A second round began one year later on January 4, 2013, and then a third round following the confirmation of a fresh clue posted on Twitter on January 4, 2014.</p3>
        <p3>The third puzzle has yet to be solved. The stated intent was to recruit "intelligent individuals" by presenting a series of puzzles to be solved; no new puzzles were published on January 4, 2015.</p3>
        <p4>A new clue was posted on Twitter on January 5, 2016. Cicada 3301 posted their last verified OpenPGP-signed message in April 2017, denying the validity of any unsigned puzzle.</p>
