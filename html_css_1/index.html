            Although there is some truth to his words, even when translated into our reality, Madara’s view of the world is probably too dark and edgy.
            He has focused all his thoughts and emotions on the darkness around him and almost forgot that the light also exists.
            Even though he mentions the dual nature of our existence, it’s as if Madara doesn’t believe that the bright side of the coin truly exists.
            That’s why he chooses to forsake reality and has the need to create a new one.
            You can see the flaws in that approach quite easily.
            Spreading love, positivity, and joy around us (much like Naruto did) is a more realistic and successful approach to bringing change in the long term.</p>

            Wake up to Reality!
            Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world.
            The longer you live, the more you will realize, that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain, suffering and futility.
            Listen...
            Everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light, there will always be shadows to be found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist.
            The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace, initiates wars.
            And Hatred is born in order to protect Love.
            There are nexuses, causal relationships that cannot be separated.
            I want to sever the fate of this world.
            
            A world of only Victors.
            A world of only Peace.
            A world of only Love.
            I will create such a World.
            
            
            I am... the Ghost of the Uchiha.
            
            For truly this reality... is a Hell.
