    <p>"You're right, all efforts are pointless...if you don't believe in yourself.</p>
    <p>"If you want to be free from your suffering, make up your mind. If you give up on your dream, you will suffer more."</p>
    <p>"It's not always possible to do what we want to do, but it's important to believe in something before you actually do it."</p>
    <p>*to Kakashi* "What is with your attitude?! We'll never be young like this again!"</p>
    <p>"That's it, Lee! Let the power of youth explode!!"</p>
    <p>"You have the gift of perseverance, and that's what makes you a genius too!"</p>
    <p>"You worked hard Lee, there's no doubt in my mind the surgery will be a success. You have the power to shape your own destiny. And on the one-in-one thousand, no, one in a million chance something to happen to go wrong, I will die right along with you. Since the day I met you, my nind≈ç has been to train you to become the most splendid ninja possible. That's a promise!"</p>
    <p>"That's it, Lee! Run...run towards the setting sun!... But don't mess up your hair!"</p>
